## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Really taking advantage of the Context API and Reducers. A big stepping stone for my journey into Redux.

### Continued development

Maybe make it mobile responsive and style it better. Lord knows I can do better. Also, I'm sure there is a bug with the toggle functionality and I know what is causing it, but I just cannot solve it right now.

### Useful resources

- [React Beautiful Dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd) - This helped me with the drag and drop functionality. The documentation is really good and easy to follow.
- [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) - Brilliant customizable toast library, loved it, will definately use again.
- [John Smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZhV0bILFb0&list=PLnHJACx3NwAe-GJ4GfptzUs8g7lFhE9DV&index=1) - He taught me most of what I know about React. The major thing here was the Context API
